# xBD Damage Assessment Pipeline

Deployment-ready pipeline for disaster type and damage classification using satellite imagery from the xBD dataset.

## Model Performance Metrics

### Localization Model
- **Architecture**: U-Net with encoder-decoder structure for building segmentation
- **Performance**: Limited by hardware constraints during training
- **Model File**: `weights/best_localization.pth`
- **Input/Output**: 1024x1024 satellite images → building segmentation masks
- **Status**: Suboptimal performance due to training limitations (see Limitations section)

### Damage Classification Model  
- **Architecture**: CNN classifier for building damage assessment
- **Overall F1 Score (Weighted)**: **84.4%** (validation set)
- **Test Set F1 Score (Weighted)**: **82.7%**
- **Model File**: `weights/best_damage.pth`
- **Input/Output**: 64x64 building patches → damage class prediction

#### Test Set Performance (F1 Score):
- **No-damage**: 92% (precision: 88%, recall: 96%)
- **Minor-damage**: 44% (precision: 61%, recall: 35%)
- **Major-damage**: 43% (precision: 55%, recall: 35%)
- **Destroyed**: 72% (precision: 76%, recall: 68%)

## Pipeline Architecture

The system operates in two stages:
1. **Building Localization**: Identifies building locations in satellite imagery
2. **Damage Classification**: Classifies damage level for each detected building

## Limitations

### Localization Model Performance
The primary limitation of this pipeline is the **localization model performance**. Due to hardware constraints (insufficient GPU memory and training time), the localization model was not trained to optimal performance levels. This directly impacts the overall pipeline effectiveness because:

- Poor building detection leads to missed damage assessments
- False positive detections create noise in damage predictions
- The damage classification model performs excellently (84.4% F1-weighted) but is limited by the quality of building detections

**Impact**: The damage classifier achieves strong performance when provided with accurate building regions, but the localization bottleneck reduces end-to-end system effectiveness.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zak-510/disaster-classifier.git
cd disaster-classifier
```

### 2. Download the Dataset
This project uses the xBD dataset. You will need to download it to train models or run inference.

1. Go to the official xView2 website: https://xview2.org/
2. Download the dataset (registration may be required)
3. Create a `Data` directory in the root of the project
4. Extract the downloaded dataset with the following structure:
```
Data/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
└── test/
    ├── images/
    └── labels/
```

### 3. Model Files
Pre-trained models are included in the repository in the `weights/` directory:
- `weights/best_localization.pth` - Building localization model
- `weights/best_damage.pth` - Damage classification model

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Run Individual Inference

#### Building Localization
```bash
python inference/localization_inference.py
```
**Output:**
- Processes 10 test images
- Generates three-panel visualizations (original, ground truth, predictions)
- Saves results to `test_results/localization/`

#### Damage Classification
```bash
python inference/damage_inference.py
```
**Output:**
- Processes 10 test images with end-to-end pipeline
- Combines localization + damage classification
- Generates colored damage visualizations
- Calculates comprehensive F1 metrics
- Saves results to `test_results/damage/`

### 2. Model Evaluation

#### Damage Classifier Evaluation
```bash
python evaluate_damage_classifier.py
```
**Output:**
- Evaluates on full test set (53,850 building patches)
- Provides detailed performance metrics
- Generates confusion matrix and classification report
- Saves detailed results to `test_results/damage_classifier_evaluation.csv`

## Test Image Coverage

The pipeline demonstrates performance across diverse disaster scenarios:

Evaluation covers ten test images spanning multiple disaster types including hurricanes (*hurricane-michael_00000366*), tsunamis (*palu-tsunami_00000181*), wildfires (*santa-rosa-wildfire_00000089*), and other natural disasters. This provides comprehensive testing across different disaster scenarios and geographic regions.

## Model Training (Optional)

### Damage Classification Model:
```bash
python training/train_damage.py
```

### Localization Model:
```bash
python training/train_localization.py
```

**Note**: Localization model training requires significant computational resources. The current model was undertrained due to hardware limitations.

## Integration & API

### Core Inference Functions:

#### Building Localization:
```python
from tests.test_localization_inference import load_localization_model, predict_localization

model, device = load_localization_model()
prediction_mask = predict_localization(model, device, image)
```

#### Damage Classification:
```python
from tests.test_damage_inference import load_models, predict_damage

loc_model, damage_model, device = load_models()
pred_damage, confidence = predict_damage(damage_model, device, patch)
```

#### Complete Pipeline:
```python
from inference.damage_inference import run_damage_inference_with_f1
f1_score = run_damage_inference_with_f1()
```

## Performance Analysis

### Damage Classification Strengths:
- Excellent performance on "destroyed" buildings (72% F1)
- Well-balanced precision/recall for most classes

### Current Limitations:
1. **Localization bottleneck**: Suboptimal building detection affects pipeline performance
2. **Class imbalance**: Minor and major damage classes show lower performance
3. **Hardware constraints**: Limited training capabilities for localization model

### Future Improvements:
- Enhanced localization model training with better hardware
- Data augmentation for minority damage classes
- Ensemble methods for improved robustness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**CUDA Out of Memory:**
- Reduce batch size in training scripts

**Model File Not Found:**
- Verify model files exist in `weights/` directory
- Check file paths in inference scripts

**Import Errors:**
- Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure PyTorch CUDA version matches your system

**Performance Issues:**
- Use GPU for inference (CPU significantly slower)
