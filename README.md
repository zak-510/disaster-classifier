## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zak-510/disaster-classifier.git
cd disaster-classifier
```

### 2. Download the Dataset
This project uses the xBD dataset. You will need to download it to train the models or run inference.

1.  Go to the official xView2 website: **[https://xview2.org/](https://xview2.org/)**
2.  Download the dataset. You may need to register.
3.  Create a `Data` directory in the root of the project.
4.  Extract the downloaded dataset and organize it so you have the following structure:
    ```
    Data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels/
    └── test/
        ├── images/
        └── labels/
    ```

### 3. Download Pre-trained Models
The pre-trained models are required to run inference without re-training. They are available as a GitHub Release.

1.  Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/zak-510/disaster-classifier/releases).
2.  Download the `models.zip` file from the latest release.
3.  Extract the contents into the root of your project directory. This should create or overwrite the `checkpoints` and `weights` directories with the pre-trained model files.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Run Localization Test (Building Detection)
```bash
python test_localization_inference.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Processes **10** test images across multiple disaster types
- Generates binary mask visualizations (black background, white buildings)
- Creates 3-panel format: Original | Ground Truth Masks | Predicted Masks
- Saves **10** PNG files to `test_results/localization/`

### 2. Run Damage Classification Test
```bash
python test_damage_inference.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Processes the same **10** test images with damage assessment
- Generates colored building visualizations on satellite background
- Creates 3-panel format: Original | Ground Truth Damage | Predicted Damage
- Saves **10** PNG files to `test_results/damage/`

### 3. Verify Complete Output
After running both scripts, you should have:
```
test_results/
├── localization/
│   ├── localization_test_1.png
│   ├── ...
│   └── localization_test_10.png
└── damage/
    ├── damage_test_1.png
    ├── ...
    └── damage_test_10.png
```

## Test Image Coverage

The pipeline demonstrates performance across diverse disaster scenarios:

The evaluation set covers ten diverse scenes, including hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, and earthquakes (e.g. *palu-tsunami_00000181*, *hurricane-michael_00000437*, *socal-fire_00001400*, *hurricane-florence_00000095*). This provides a broad sanity-check on generalisation without using any training data.

## Model Training (Optional)

If you need to retrain models:

### Localization Model:
```bash
python train_localization.py
```

### Damage Classification Model:
```bash
python train_damage.py
```

**Note**: Training requires significant computational resources and time.

## Integration & API

### Core Inference Functions:

#### Building Localization:
```python
from localization_inference import run_localization_inference
results = run_localization_inference(image_path)
```

#### Damage Classification:
```python
from damage_inference import run_damage_inference  
results = run_damage_inference(image_path)
```

#### Full Pipeline:
```python
from pipeline_inference import run_full_pipeline
results = run_full_pipeline(image_path)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**CUDA Out of Memory:**
- Reduce batch size in training scripts
- Ensure sufficient GPU memory (4GB+ required)

**Model File Not Found:**
- Verify model files exist in correct locations
- Check file paths in inference scripts

**Import Errors:**
- Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure PyTorch CUDA version matches your system

**Performance Issues:**
- Use GPU for inference (CPU inference is significantly slower)
- Verify CUDA is properly installed and accessible
