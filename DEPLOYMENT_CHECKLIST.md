- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed

### ✅ Dependencies Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- [ ] PyTorch with CUDA installed successfully
- [ ] OpenCV (cv2) installed
- [ ] NumPy, Matplotlib installed
- [ ] Shapely, scikit-image installed
- [ ] tqdm installed

### ✅ Model Files Present
- [ ] `checkpoints/extended/model_epoch_20.pth` exists (localization model)
- [ ] `weights/best_damage_model_optimized.pth` exists (damage model)
- [ ] Both model files are accessible and not corrupted

### ✅ Test Data Present
- [ ] `Data/test/images/` contains test satellite images
- [ ] `Data/test/labels/` contains corresponding JSON labels
- [ ] All 4 test images available:
  - [ ] hurricane-florence_00000007
  - [ ] hurricane-michael_00000366  
  - [ ] socal-fire_00001226
  - [ ] hurricane-florence_00000013

## FUNCTIONAL TESTING

### ✅ Localization Pipeline Test
```bash
python test_localization_inference.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Model loads successfully from checkpoint
- [ ] Processes all 4 test images
- [ ] Generates 4 PNG files in `test_results/localization/`
- [ ] Files show proper 3-panel format (Original | GT Masks | Predicted Masks)
- [ ] Binary masks display correctly (black background, white buildings)

### ✅ Damage Classification Test  
```bash
python test_damage_inference.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Both models (localization + damage) load successfully
- [ ] Processes all 4 test images
- [ ] Generates 4 PNG files in `test_results/damage/`
- [ ] Files show proper 3-panel format (Original | GT Damage | Predicted Damage)
- [ ] Colored building pixels display correctly on satellite background
- [ ] Ground truth vs predicted buildings properly separated

## OUTPUT VERIFICATION

### ✅ Complete File Structure
After running both test scripts, verify:
```
test_results/
├── localization/
│   ├── localization_test_1.png  ← Hurricane Florence 00000007
│   ├── localization_test_2.png  ← Hurricane Michael 00000366
│   ├── localization_test_3.png  ← SoCal Fire 00001226
│   └── localization_test_4.png  ← Hurricane Florence 00000013
└── damage/
    ├── damage_test_1.png         ← Hurricane Florence 00000007
    ├── damage_test_2.png         ← Hurricane Michael 00000366
    ├── damage_test_3.png         ← SoCal Fire 00001226
    └── damage_test_4.png         ← Hurricane Florence 00000013
```

### ✅ Expected Building Counts
Verify processing output shows correct building counts:
- [ ] Hurricane Florence 00000007: 16 GT buildings, 15 predicted
- [ ] Hurricane Michael 00000366: 1 GT building, 1 predicted
- [ ] SoCal Fire 00001226: 1 GT building, 1 predicted  
- [ ] Hurricane Florence 00000013: 50 GT buildings, 18 predicted

### ✅ Performance Metrics Validation
- [ ] Damage classification accuracy: 70.2% (TARGET MET ✅)
- [ ] Per-class performance documented
- [ ] No critical errors in inference logs
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits

## PRODUCTION READINESS

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] All working Python scripts preserved
- [ ] No temporary or debug files present
- [ ] Import statements functional
- [ ] Professional logging format (no emojis)
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### ✅ Documentation Complete
- [ ] README.md provides comprehensive deployment guide
- [ ] Hardware/software requirements documented
- [ ] Usage examples included
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available
- [ ] Directory structure documented

### ✅ Integration Ready
- [ ] Core inference functions accessible via import

- [ ] Pipeline modular and extensible
- [ ] Performance monitoring included

## DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### Quick Start Test Sequence:
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Test localization pipeline
python test_localization_inference.py
